# Technigo - React Portfolio Project

Week 8 of Technigo boot camp: building my own portfolio website using API and React hooks. Got a design to follow. Accessibility has been taken into thought.


### Info and Problem-solving

The project was the biggest one so far. I had four days to try to finalize it. Re-usable components and accessibility was new this week. Accessibility is something I've worked with before, allthough not in coding, but this made this week extra interesting for me. And I think I've got a lot for free keeping the accessibility in my mind throughout the project. The test with Lighthouse gave the following values:
Performance: 100, Accessibility: 96, Best practices: 95, SEO: 80.

A lot of time was put into the styling. Stack overflow, course material and my team were used when problems occured. Got help and helped others which has been really good for the learning process!

With more time I would (I will) work on the reponsiveness.
